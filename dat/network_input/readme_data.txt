This directory contains input data for MHC-I predictions
It is based on Eluted Ligand data from the IEDB
Only 9-mer ligands from human MHC I alleles were extracted
It has been split into a test and training set, 1/5 and 4/5 respectively
The partitions were made so no ligand in the test set shares a 7-mer motif with a ligand in the training set, and vice versa
